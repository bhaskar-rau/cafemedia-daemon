Day:
	what the actual fuck is wrong with people ? they get paid, they get all the work done from me. they treated me like shit in the past. it is inevitable to sometimes remember those brutal experiences and ask for an apology. but still she says she doesnt have patience to say a fucking sorry for he way she made me feel. i cried and worked through stress, bitterness and jealousy. i was feeling so miserable at some point, i seeked an ai bot for help -a good one ofcourse. i shared with the bot how miserable i felt and all these emotions of not getting enough credit, not feeling enough involvement and not getting anything from that worthless piece of shit. i had these same feelings a lot of times through out these times. a lot of times, i felt so sad and jealous. i even cried for that horrible person. i lost my fucking job because i dont want to work in a place where the person who i treated as my own sister, want to reduce talking and caring for me because of some other guy. and in return for that, she put out a sorry message and an emotional fucking message only to make me fucking cry? oh and after that I had to watch those bags every fucking day and work for her thinking that im special ? and all the time she is spending relaxed time with him ? i mean all the actual fuck i get is thinara and rest theskunara ?? for fucks sake youve been through a lot. my god! enough is enough! this is done. it is time to live the life that is inspired by reading, running and food and fashion communities. it is time to live a life where you can find joy.
