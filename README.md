# Cafemedia Daemon

Cafemedia Daemon is a Spring and Java-based backend service built with Maven. This project aims to help foodies explore and post content exclusively about food, fostering a community focused on culinary experiences.

## 
Cafemedia allows users to share food images without the clutter of comments or likes. Interactions are simplified; users can slide entire posts to add them to sections like **"Want to Visit"** or slide specific dishes to **"Want to Try This Dish."**. 

### Features
- **Minimal Interaction**: Users cannot comment or like posts, ensuring a distraction-free experience.
- **Key Information Displayed**: Each food post includes:
  - Restaurant or caf√© name
  - Location    `
  - Image of the food
  - Menu name of the dish
  - Experience and taste ratings (Note: I prefer not to use stars or numbers for ratings and plan to implement a unique alternative.)
